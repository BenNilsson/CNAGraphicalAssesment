# Concurrent Network Applications - Graphical Assignment 
 
For this university module, we were tasked to create a multi-threaded networked application with a server-client topology.
Part of the artefact included a graphical application. I personally chose to make a small game using [MonoGame](https://www.monogame.net/).

The transport layer uses TCP and UDP to send data between server and client and is built using .NET in C#.
TCP is used when dealing with connection packets, whereas UDP was used for movement and the animations.
